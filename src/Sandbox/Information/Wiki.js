          In a nutshell, Machine Learning (ML) refers to computer applications that self-improve over time.  In order to pull this off, ML applications typically take a large amount of data as input in order to be accurate (the process of feeding data into a Machine Learning algorithm is referred to as “training”).  During training, the ML algorithm determines to which set of categories a new observation belongs (“classification”).  If our ML algorithm is to be accurate, we’ll need to specify a set of categories, or “classifiers”, that make sense for our given application.

          With training, these classifiers improve and become more accurate over time.  There are a number of different algorithms, or “models”,  that can be used to achieve this, and in this sandbox, we’ll explore the following models: linear regression classifier, random forest classifier, Gaussian mixture classifier, and support vector classifier. Other common models include (but are not limited to) neural networks, k-means clustering, and logistic regression.
